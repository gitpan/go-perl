2005-01-31      - [cjm] changed dependencies in Makefile.PL
                  Data::Stag 0.07 is the only dependency
                  (and as of 0.08, no dependencies for Data::Stag)

                - [cjm] XML::LibXML now used in place of xsltproc hack

                - [cjm] Added acc2name_h to base_parser - index
                  can be used for fast ID checking during parsing

                - [cjm] fixed litemode to report namespace
                        (map2slim no longer complains)

                - [cjm] fixed prob with go_ont_parser
                        files with '*' as a type code

2005-02-01      - [cjm] map2slim now uses no_duplicates option 

2005-02-08      - [cjm] new scripts:
                        go-dag-summary.pl
                        go-filter-subset.pl
                        go-show-paths-to-root.pl
2005-03-14      - [cjm] new parser/handler: obj_storable
                        added caching to parser
                        new script option: -use_cache

2005-03-28      - [cjm] added go-apply-xslt to go-perl/scripts

2005-04-02      - [cjm] obo_text output date is now oboedit compatible

2005-04-16      - [cjm] fixed subtle obo_text_parser bug
                         is_root was not being set if the root term      
                         was immediately followed by a Typedef stanza

2005-05-20      - [cjm] allowed unsetting of $term->synonym_list
                - [cjm] new scripts
                         go-show-assocs-by-node.pl
                         go-apply-xslt
2005-05-25      - [cjm] xslt processing: behaviour unchanged for when
                        GO_ROOT is set; if GO_ROOT is not set, then
                        the install directory (eg %INC{GO/..}) is checked
                        for the xsl directory. This makes things easier
                        for users who wish to use go-perl and the xslts
                        without downloading and installing all of go-dev
                        This affects:
                          go-apply-xslt
                          GO::Parsers::base_parser

2005-06-29      - [cjm] now accepts obo1.2 format synonyms
                        accepts obo1.2 xref tag (maps to xref_analog in xml)
