Installing go-perl
==================

First set the environment variable GO_ROOT to where you have the
go-dev directoryy on your system

bash shells:

  export GO_ROOT=$HOME/go-dev

other shells:

  setenv GO_ROOT $HOME/go-dev

Installing system wide:

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install

...Or you can just use the modules without installing them [ie skip
the "make install step]

Assuming you have unpacked the go-dev distribution in your home directory:

setenv PERL5LIB "$PERL5LIB:~/go-dev/go-perl"
setenv PATH "$PATH:~/go-dev/scripts"

For full documentation, see the doc/ directory

You may be prompted to install other third party perl modules. These
will all be available via CPAN. If you have not used CPAN before, type
this:

perl -MCPAN -e shell
<<follow setup instructions>>
install <<Module name here>>
quit
